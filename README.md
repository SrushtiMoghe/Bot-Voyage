🤖 Bot Voyage - NLP Chatbot using LangChain (RAG and CRAG)

This project is a tourism-based chatbot developed using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with LangChain. The bot is designed in two phases:

- **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- **CRAG** (Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## 🛠️ Objective
To enhance response accuracy and contextual understanding for tourism-related queries by integrating curated external knowledge sources.

## 📁 Files Included
- `NLP_MiP_Group_5RAG.ipynb`: Basic chatbot using RAG.
- `NLP_MiP_Group_5CRAG.ipynb`: Enhanced chatbot using CRAG for more accurate responses.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset used includes:
- Scraped content from government tourism portals
- Articles and blogs related to Indian tourism
- Manually integrated festival, state, and safety information

It covers:
- State-wise tourism stats
- Cultural festivals
- Best travel seasons
- Safety tips

## ✅ Features
- Uses LangChain for LLM integration
- Implements vector-based document retrieval
- Comparison between RAG vs CRAG performance

## 📈 Accuracy Insight
Based on prompt evaluations, CRAG showed a **30% improvement** in factual accuracy and contextual depth over RAG.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Install dependencies using `!pip install -r requirements.txt` (add if needed)
3. Follow cell execution to interact with the chatbot
